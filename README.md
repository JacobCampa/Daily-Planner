# Daily-Planner

## Description

This application is designed to help the user plan out their day while it shows a color background represnting if the time slot is currently in the past, present, or future.
The user will be able to add an event and save it into local storage so if the page refreshes the content will stay there. Creating this application thought me how to use jquery and bootstrap as a third party api to manipulate the DOM and attributes of the html. THis project was fairly straight forward and given the starter code was easy to figure out what adjustments were needed to complete the assignment.

Depending on the time of day, the time slots will change colors (past: Grey, present: Red, future: Green)
